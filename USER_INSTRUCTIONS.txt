Arena Queue Detector - User Instructions
=======================================

What this is
------------
A small Windows app that watches your screen for the "Enter Arena" prompt and sends a message to your Discord via a webhook. You can also enable periodic reminders to move your character so you do not get logged out while waiting in queue.

System requirements
-------------------
- Windows 10/11
- Tesseract OCR installed on your system
  - Download: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
  - The app will try to auto-detect it (common paths and PATH)
- Internet access for Discord webhooks

Download and run (.exe)
-----------------------
1) Go to the GitHub repository Releases page and download `ArenaQueueDetector.exe`.
2) Double-click the `.exe` to run it.
   - If Windows SmartScreen appears: click "More info" → "Run anyway".

First-time setup
----------------
1) Copy your Discord Webhook URL
   - Discord server → Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks → New Webhook → Copy URL
2) Get your Discord User ID (for mentions)
   - Discord → User Settings → Advanced → enable Developer Mode
   - Right-click your username → Copy ID
3) In the app, paste your Webhook URL and your User ID
4) (Optional) Enable periodic reminders and set the interval in minutes
5) Click "Start Monitoring"

How it works
------------
- The app monitors a specific screen region where the "Enter Arena" prompt appears
- When detected, it sends a webhook message mentioning your User ID
- If reminders are enabled, it sends a periodic "move your character" message while waiting (until the prompt is detected)
- Your settings are saved to `config.ini` in the app folder

Common actions
--------------
- Start monitoring: Click "Start Monitoring"
- Stop monitoring: Click "Stop Monitoring"
- Test OCR area: Click "Test OCR Area" to save screenshots and print OCR results

Troubleshooting
---------------
Tesseract not found
- Install Tesseract
- Reopen the app after installation
- Ensure `tesseract.exe` is in a standard path (see the Tesseract wiki) or added to PATH

Discord messages not sending
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and active
- Confirm the channel permissions allow webhook messages
- Validate your Discord User ID is a number (not your username)

OCR not detecting
- Ensure the monitored area includes the "Enter Arena" button
- Try different game resolutions/UI scales
- Use "Test OCR Area" and review `debug_screenshot.png` and `debug_processed.png`

Privacy and data
----------------
- The app only sends messages to the Discord webhook you configure
- No data is uploaded elsewhere

Uninstall / removal
-------------------
- Delete the `.exe` and any generated files (e.g., `config.ini`, `debug_*.png`)

Contact / feedback
------------------
- Open an issue or discussion on the GitHub repository if you have problems or suggestions
